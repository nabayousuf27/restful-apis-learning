# RESTful APIs Learning  

This repository documents my learning journey and practice with **RESTful APIs**. It covers REST concepts, CRUD operations, and examples of how RESTful services are designed and implemented.

## 🌐 What is REST?  
**REST** stands for **Representational State Transfer**.  
It is an **architectural style** that defines a set of **constraints and principles** for designing web services (a collection of APIs).  

- REST is **not a technology**, but a set of rules/constraints.  
- RESTful APIs are APIs that follow these REST principles.  
- They are widely used to perform **CRUD operations** on resources.

## 📌 RESTful API Basics  

- **Resource**: The object/entity on which CRUD operations are performed.  
  - Example: `users`, `products`, `orders`  

### CRUD Operations in REST  
- **GET** → Retrieve resources  
- **POST** → Submit new data to the server (create)  
- **PUT** → Update existing data (or partially update)  
- **DELETE** → Remove data  

> ✅ REST best practice: use **nouns** for endpoints instead of verbs.
